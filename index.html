    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>

      <p>In this short section I will introduce what intellectual property (IP) is
      in a business environment. This is for better understanding the importance
      of securing and managing your business' web security from some of the more
      common threats.</p>
      
      <p>There are several risks of being unaware of how to manage and protect the
      businesses IP. A cyberattack against your business is not only a threat to
      the business' copyright, patent, control over innovation and
      inventiveness, but it may expose sensitive information about the branding
      or product, or leak private information about the client or user. In the
      next section I will address some practices in web security.</p>
      
      <p>According to acunetix.com, one of the current best practices for building
      secure software is investing in SecDevOps. By integrating security tools
      to the DevOps pipelines, the developer is informed about any
      vulnerabilities in it. It is also recommended to use security tools like
      vulnerability scanner combined with network scanning. Many busnisses use
      WAF (web application firewall), but you should be aware that a WAF is a
      part of complete security, but not the most important line of defence. You
      can also performe security exercises like for example Red team vs. Blue
      team, and your security will be challenged continuously while your
      business will remain prepared for any attack.</p>
      
      <p>Be sure to invest in a web security that is able to perform mock attacks
      and penetration testing continuously, and use diverse security measures
      that is as much ass possible integrated and automated.</p>
